- fixed bug: missing files are included into package now

0.2.0 - Dez 13, 2015
--------------------

- fixed bugs in f0 tracking
- analyze() method in class ScoreInformedSoloAnalysis now takes three audio file names for each analysis step
  (tuning estimation, loudness estimation, f0 tracking)
- this can be useful if e.g. source separation algorithms were used to split an audio recording into an audio
  file with the main melody instrument (useful for loudness analysis and f0 tracking) and one with all other
  instruments (useful for tuning analysis)
